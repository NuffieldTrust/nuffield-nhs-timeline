								<p>Pay is poor, particularly for GPs, and often based on pre-war values.  Emigration is increasingly common. </p>
								<p>The Royal Commission is appointed in March 1957 to settle an ongoing dispute between the medical profession and the Government over pay, which even leads to the Conservative Government planning for a ‘phased withdrawal’ from the NHS.</p>
								<p>It attempts to reach a formula that would satisfy both parties and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1903166/">publishes its recommendations</a> in 1960. A key recommendation is the creation of an independent review body system for deciding NHS doctors’ and dentists’ pay.</p>

								<p>Enoch Powell is an enthusiastic sponsor of the <a target="_blank" href="http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/1962/feb/14/the-hospital-plan">Hospital Plan</a>, which he describes as “an opportunity to plan the hospital system on a scale which is not possible anywhere else certainly on this side of the Iron Curtain”.</p>
								<p>The objective is to remedy a decade of neglect, closing many hospitals and replacing them with new or extended facilities.</p>
								<p>£570 million is pledged over 10 years to provide a national network of district general hospitals throughout the UK. However, in time this is shown to be an underestimate of the costs involved.</p>

								<p>Robinson was instructed to explore possible changes to the NHS administration by the then Prime Minister, Harold Wilson, following numerous criticisms of its tripartite structure and other organisational deficiencies.</p>
								<p>The Green Paper recommends the creation of about 50 area boards in a single organisational tier, taking responsibility for all health functions in each administrative area.</p>

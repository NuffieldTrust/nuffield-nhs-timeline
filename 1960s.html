								<p>Pay is poor, particularly for GPs, and often based on pre-war values.  Emigration is increasingly common. </p>
								<p>The Royal Commission is appointed in March 1957 to settle an ongoing dispute between the medical profession and the Government over pay, which even leads to the Conservative Government planning for a ‘phased withdrawal’ from the NHS.</p>
								<p>It attempts to reach a formula that would satisfy both parties and publishes its recommendations in 1960. A key recommendation is the creation of an independent review body system for deciding NHS doctors’ and dentists’ pay.</p>

								<p>£570 million is pledged over 10 years to provide a national network of district general hospitals throughout the UK. However, in time this is shown to be an underestimate of the costs involved.</p>

								<p>By the early 1960s, GPs are complaining of neglect and impoverishment.  Morale is poor and recruitment is proving difficult. The seeming crisis leads to the Family Doctors Charter, which receives widespread support from the profession (including the threat of 18,000 resignations if it is not implemented).</p>

						<p>The publication of Kenneth Robinson’s Green Paper, <i>Administrative structure of the medical and related services in England and Wales</i>, presages years of argument about the organisational structure of the NHS.

								<p>In 1956, Kenneth Robinson, the Minister of Health, publishes the first Green Paper on the NHS.</p>
								<p>Robinson was instructed to explore possible changes to the NHS administration by the then Prime Minister, Harold Wilson, following numerous criticisms of its tripartite structure and other organisational deficiencies.</p>
								<p>The Green Paper recommends the creation of about 50 area boards in a single organisational tier, taking responsibility for all health functions in each administrative area.</p>

								<p>The right to medical treatment for everyone under a new national health service is proposed by an <a href="http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1942beveridge.asp">inter-departmental committee led by Sir William Beveridge</a>. The committee was asked to: “undertake, with special reference to the inter-relation of the schemes, a survey of the existing national schemes of social insurance and allied services”.</p>
								<p>One of the provisions of Beveridge’s committee was that: “medical treatment covering all requirements will be provided for all citizens by a national health service organised under the health departments and post-medical rehabilitation treatment will be provided for all persons capable of profiting by it”.</p>

								<p>The <a href="http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/+/www.dh.gov.uk/en/Aboutus/HowDHworks/DH_074813">NHS is founded</a> on 5 July 1948, following an official unveiling at Park Hospital (now Trafford General Hospital) in Manchester. 1,143 voluntary hospitals with some 90,000 beds and 1,545 municipal hospitals with 390,000 beds are subsumed within the new NHS. </p>
								<p>General practitioners remain self-employed and largely independent, having argued successfully for a contract for service rather than a contract of service.</p>

								<p>A new three-part bureaucracy is created to manage the service, comprising : 14 regional hospital boards (RHBs), 36 boards of governors for teaching hospitals (BGs) and 388 hospital management committees (HMCs); 138 executive councils (ECs); and 147 local health authorities (LHAs).</p>

								<blockquote>It is the policy of the Government to relieve nurses of all work not requiring nursing skill.</blockquote>
								<p>A depleted labour market after the war means that the Government has begun to look overseas to help increase nursing numbers and the UK sees a large influx of nurses from the Caribbean.</p>

								<p>The educational role of the [then] nurse regulator – the General Nursing Council (GNC) – is strengthened and a new syllabus for general training is completed and approved in 1952.</p>

								<blockquote>The Review flags the need for a very substantial increase in resources for health and social care.</blockquote>
								<p>In the light of the Prime Minister’s commitment, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Gordon Brown, asks Sir Derek Wanless, a banker, to <a href="http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/+/http:/www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/consult_wanless_final.htm">review the long-term funding needs of the NHS.</a></p>
								<p>Published in April 2002, his report suggests that future funding needs will depend on the extent to which future demand for health care is reduced by good public health policies and by disease prevention. </p>
								<p>The report justifies what is to be a 50 per cent real-terms increase in NHS spending over the five years after its publication.</p>

								<p>The document outlines plans to: better engage local clinicians in the design of services; roll-out practice-based commissioning universally and to a faster timetable; develop primary care trusts (PCTs) to support practice-based commissioning; and to review the functions of strategic health authorities (SHAs) to support commissioning and contract management. </p>
								<p>The document instructs PCTs to “make arrangements for 100 per cent coverage of practice-based commissioning by no later than the end of 2006”, although individual practices are given some flexibility to take on commissioning to a greater or lesser extent depending on their wishes and capabilities. </p>
								<p>All budgets are set to be ‘indicative’ only, with PCTs continuing to hold the actual funds.</p>
